html5-template
=============
Goal:
Starting point for website prototyping, gather all the tools that will help you doing it faster. 

Required to run this:
- ruby
- bundle

Components:
- middleman - deploys, runs static sites, builds everything, intergrates with compass
- scss - nobody writes just css anymore, I prefer scss over sass or less.
- haml - less closing tags - less typing.
- compass - css's best practice in one place
- jquery 1.8.0 - most used version og jquery for me, probably will update later.
- html5shiv - probably modernizer is a better choice, but html5shiv requires no time from my side.

Starting up:
- bundle install
- = make changes =
- middleman server
