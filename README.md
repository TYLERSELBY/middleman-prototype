html5-prototype
=============
## Goal ##
Starting point for website prototyping, gather all the tools that will help doing presenting first wireframes as fast as possible. 

## Components ##
- middleman - deploys, runs static sites, builds everything, intergrates with compass
- scss - nobody writes just css anymore, I prefer scss over sass or less.
- haml - less closing tags - less typing.
- compass - css's best practice in one place
- jquery 1.8.0 - most used version og jquery for me, probably will update later.
- html5shiv - probably modernizer is a better choice, but html5shiv requires no time from my side.

## Installation ##

Clone into ~/.middleman (you'll have to create this directory if it's not already there). You can then use it with the `--template` flag on `middleman init`.

1. $ `git clone git://github.com/skatkov/middleman-prototype.git ~/.middleman/prototype`
2. $ `middleman init my_new_project --template=prototype`
